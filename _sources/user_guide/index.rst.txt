User Guide
__________

The User Guide is the primary resource documenting key concepts that
will help you use HoloViews in your work. For newcomers, a gentle
introduction to HoloViews can be found in our `Getting Started <../getting_started/index.html>`_
guide and an overview of some interesting HoloViews examples can be
found in our `Gallery <../gallery/index.html>`_. If you are looking for a specific component
(or wish to view the available range of primitives), see our
`Reference Gallery <../reference/index.html>`_.
